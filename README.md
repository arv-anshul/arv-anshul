<h3 align="center" style="font-weight: bold;">My Projects</h3>

1. [PW Skills API](https://github.com/arv-anshul/pw-api): I used **PW (Physics Wallah) private api(s)** which they were used to display there courses on their website and run their courses. I have done lot of work around it and create a Streamlit application in which user can login with their course account and fetch courses data.
2. [Simple Attendance System](https://github.com/arv-anshul/attendaadnce-system): This project uses MongoDB, Streamlit and Python techs to work. Which perform **CRUD** operations on MongoDB Databases.
3. [Backorder Prediction System](http://github.com/arv-anshul/ineuron-backorder-prediction): My first end-to-end machine learning project with modular programming with documentation. This project is from Ineuron Internship Portal.
4. [PW Course Assignment Solution](http://github.com/arv-anshul/pw-impact-batch): I use NLP concepts to build this project. Also, I gather data for this project in different way.
